        <div id="sarhul">
            <h2>Sarhul</h2>
            <p>Sarhul is celebrated during spring season and the Saal trees get new flowers on their branches. It is a
                worship of the village deity who is considered to be the protector of the tribes. People sing and dance
                a lot when the new flowers appear. The deities are worshiped with saal flowers. The village priest or
                Pahan fasts for a couple of days. In the early morning he takes a bath and puts on new a dhoti made of
                virgin cotton (kachha dhaga). The previous evening, the Pahan takes three new earthen pots and fills
                them with fresh water; the next morning he observes these earthen pots and water level inside. If the
                water level decreases he predicts that there would be famine or less rain, and if the water level is
                normal, that is the signal of a good rain. Before pooja starts, the wife of the Pahan washes his feet
                and gets blessings from him. At the pooja, Pahan offers three young roosters of different colors to one
                for the almighty god â€” the Singbonga or Dharmesh, as the Mundas, Ho and Oraons respectively address
                Him; another for the village deities; and the third for the ancestors. During this pooja villagers
                surround the Sarna place.</p>

            <p>Traditional drum â€” Dhol, Nagara and Turhi â€” players keep drumming and playing along with Pahan
                chanting prayers to deities. When pooja is finished, boys carry Pahan on their shoulders and girls
                dancing ahead take him to his house where his wife welcomes him by washing his feet. Then Pahan offers
                Saal flowers to her wife and villagers. These flowers represent the brotherhood and friendship among
                villagers and Pahan the priest, distributes saal flowers to every villager. He also puts saals flowers
                on every house's roof which is called "phool khonsi". At the same time Prasad, a rice made beer called
                Handia, is distributed among the villagers. And the whole village celebrates with singing and dancing
                this festival of Sarhul. It goes on for weeks in this region of Chhotanagpur. In Kolhan region it is
                called "Baa Porob" meaning Flower Festival. it is the festival of the grest happiness.</p>

        <div id="karam">
            <h2>Karam</h2>
            <p>The Karam festival is a worship of Karam devta, the god of power, youth and youthfulness. Karam is held
                on the 11 of moon in Bhadra month. Groups of young villagers go to the jungle and collect wood, fruits
                and flowers. These are required during the Puja of Karam God. During this period people sing and dance
                in groups. The entire valley seems to be dancing with the drumbeatth day of the phases. This is one of
                the rare examples of such a vital and vibrant youth festival in Jharkhand's tribal area.</p>

        <div id="jawa">
            <h2>Jawa</h2>
            <p>At the same time, the unmarried tribal girls celebrate the Jawa festival, which has its own kind of songs
                and dance. This is held mainly for the expectation of good fertility and better household. The unmarried
                girls decorate a small basket with germinating seeds. It is believed that the worship for good
                germination of the grains would increase the fertility. The girls offer green melons to the Karam deity
                as a symbol of 'son' which reveals the primitive expectation of human being (i.e., grains and children).
                The entire tribal area of Jharkhand becomes tipsy during this time.</p>

            <h2>Tusu Parab or Makar</h2>
            <p>This festival is mostly seen in the area between Bundu, Tamar and Raidih area of Jaharkhand. This belt
                has a great history during India's independence movement. TUSU is a harvest festival held during the
                winter in the last day of Poush month. It is also for the unmarried girls. Girls decorate a wooden/
                bamboo frame with coloured paper and then gift it to the nearby hilly river. Although there is no
                documented history available on this festival but it has huge collection of scintillating songs full of
                life and taste. These songs reflect the simplicity and innocence of tribal people.</p>

            <h2>Chhath Pooja</h2>

                Jharkhand. Chhath Puja is reckoned as one of the most important festivals of Jharkhand.. During this
                festival the setting Sun is worshipped with utmost sincerity and devotion. The inhabitants of the state
                have immense faith on this auspicious festival, which is celebrated two times a year once in the month
                of Chaitra or March, and the other time in which it is celebrated is the month of Kartik, which falls in
                the month of November. The harmonious melody of the lyrics chanted during this festival lets one immerse
                in the sanctity and the purity of this auspicious occasion. Besides the Hindus, some of the Muslims also
                actively participate in the holy ceremony. If we opt for redefining this festival then we can say that
                it is an expression of seeking blessings from the forces of the nature, thus representing the
                amalgamation of the Vedic and non-Aryan religion. </p>
