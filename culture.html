            <h2>TRIBALS</h2>
            <h3>Munda</h3>
            <p style="float:left;"><b>Munda</b> is a powerful tribe of the Cholarian group in Jharkhand. Munda treats his
                native
                land Tibet From there, came to Madhya Pradesh from the treaty land of Karnataka and Maharashtra.
                According to a folk tale popular in the Munda society, the original place of Munda is considered to be
                Tibet but it is not logical to accept the idea of ​​this myth that the naked bush is taken. Tibet has
                been a snowy state and his mining and costume for the snowy region does not match with the present Munda
                tribe of Jharkhand.</p>
            <img src="http://jharkhandculture.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Munda.jpg" alt="munda"
                style="float:right;" width="300px">
            <p>Even with sociological point of view, the Mundas do not see the native inhabitants of
                Tibet. The biggest thing is that Tibet has always been a religion-prana country, and before being
                influenced by Buddhist philosophy, the fierce rivalry and rebirth against the rebels. The same thing
                takes the Mundas to this myth that at the level of the language, Tibetan hieroglyphs are found in the
                script of Mohanjodaro, which may have been written by Munda. But the coordination of most of the life of
                this tribe lives more than the south.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Oraon</h3>
            <h4>Introduction:</h4>
            <p style="float: :left;"><b>Oraon</b> is an important and majority tribe of Jharkhand. Sathal's dispute is
                its
                second position. According to the census of 1994, total population of Oraon1 137666, mainly in old
                districts Ranchi (76.19 per cent), Palamu (43-82 per cent), Brijarival (5 per cent), Singhbhum (3.62 per
                cent) and Sanpal Paragana (1 13 Percent).</p>
            <img src="http://jharkhandculture.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/oraon.jpg" alt="munda"
                style="float:right;" width="300px">

            <p>Oraon is called 'Kurukh' in your language. The word kurukhhu is related to the Sanskrit ambitu 'karsha'
                (hull), which became cooper, kuhushar, kurukhhu through traction. Being from 'traction' to 'kurkhar'
                from 'traction' is related to Nasikta.</p>

            <p>It is also believed that the name of khukh may have been originally derived from extinct garlic metal,
                which means 'human'. Traditionally, in all the tribes, there is a tradition of saying human only by not
                telling any caste. Moda or Ho is called Horo (Human). The word 'Cole' which seems to be used
                collectively for the entire tribe (Munda too) is the original meaning - human. Similarly, 'Male' (tribe)
                means Jan, Ashkimo is called "Inuit". It also means money. Kalahari '- living in the desert' Bushman
                'and Hontotot' calls itself 'lost', which also means 'human'. Homophobia is a great feature of tribals
                in humans, whose development can only establish unity in diversity. The word 'Karman', which is derived
                from the Rigveda, is used in the form of an expression of 'Jan'. Vedas, Brahmins and Samhita have been
                mentioned as "Five People".</p>

            <p>A big interesting description of the origin of this name is found in a Oraonfolklore. First, in the
                distant past, a muni ascetic, remained absorbed in penance in the same posture for years of non-food.
                During this long period, his body turned into a balmiki or bandi, i.e. termites covered by late. A
                shredded tree came up in which a long - 3 3 entered into their ur (chest) In the end, a logarithm
                forgetting the muni as a termite of the termite, it was broken by the bent of Kulharri and broke it, but
                he remained silent.</p>

            When found a living man Due to this in a rude manner, the deviated monk stood abreast of being young.
            Then the thorn thorn in his chest broke and the blood started flowing. The mother (mother) did not have
            blood stains, by this desire she filled her in Anjali. When they experienced the relapse, they did not
            give the address and filled it with blood and put them in a shady place nearby. With this blood, a boy
            and a girl (brother-in-law) appeared. Then the muni walked from here. From that point of view, those
            people who saw Muni go, do not leave and leave. You have brought us into the world. How will our
            livelihood work? "Muni replied," You will become a farmer, you will become a farmer. Clean this forest
            and make cultivation your profession. "These were the first ancestors (parents) of Ueno, who were born
            from the blood of Muni's 'ur', hence 'Uraon', here it is important that it is fine In relation to the
            origin of four types of this type of story, there is also that the Brahma's head, the karmas from the
            arms, arms or chest, drunk by the Vaishya and the feet from the abdomen</p>

                <h3>Dhokra Art</h3>
                <p>Jharcraft brings you the primordial handicraft of Dhokra, an art-form handed down through the
                    generations. Dhokra metal art reflects the creativity of life in its varied forms. From the
                    pre-historic period, the Rana and certain communities of Jharkhand have been making the metal
                    visions in bronze and copper.</p>
                <p>Directorate of Hand-loom, Sericulture and Handicraft, Department of Industry, Government of
                    Jharkhand, in associations with “Kalamandir”, Jamshedpur got the metal craftsmen together and
                    started a new era of Dhokra. Jharcraft has extended full marketing support to the group. Today
                    Dhokra metal images and ornaments are made in the same way as it was done in the past. Though the
                    process and style has remained very traditional, Kalamandir has given a finish to their skills.
                    Dhokra artisans create their imaginations in clay with conventional design and patterns. They use
                    dhuna, risen from the bark of tree, heated with cold tar to make wax threads and tapes for
                    ornamentation on clay sculpture. For filler, Bronze or copper is liquefied along with zinc and the
                    molten metal is poured in. Burning off the wax, the liquid metal takes the shape of the model.
                    Knocking off the dried clay outcomes the Dhokra metal handicraft. Acclaimed the world over, the
                    artistic metal forms are an aesthetic delight for the purest as well as for the general collector of
                    folk art. Dhokra art is the metallic manifestation of primitive simplicity caste in instinctive
                    forms and cared by Jharcraft.</p>
                <p>It is also practiced in the neighboring states sharing common political boundaries and similar
                    cultures. It is basically a brass-work (Metal Craft) done by the Malhore castes of the state. Brass
                    is a combination of copper and zinc. The artisans of Jharkhand practice the traditional “Lost Wax
                    Technique” to craft their imaginations. They use wax, resin and firewood from the forests, clay from
                    the riverbed and make the firing oven in a hole dug in the ground. Through the craft the artists
                    present the different aspects of life.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Terracota Craft</h3>
                <p>“Everything that obliterates into dust…………is given birth in form of a new creation by Mother Earth.”
                </p>
                <p>Jharcraft has given a new form to the loam in form of this craft. Jharcraft is not only making decor
                    items and mementoes of terracotta but has also added a new chapter in the Jewellery market.
                    Teracotta dinner sets and tea sets are a new addition to this diversified craft. The speciality of
                    these utensils is that these are lead-freeand are free from the hazardous colour pigments which may
                    be harmful for the health. These are eco friendly products, which are being developed in the Bundu
                    cluster and are being supervised by the “Adhaar Mahila Samiti”.
