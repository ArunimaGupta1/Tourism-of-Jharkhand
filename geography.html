    <h2 id="climate">Climate</h2>
    <p>There are three well-defined seasons in Jharkhand. The cold-weather season, from November to February, is the
        most pleasant part of the year. High temperatures in Ranchi in December usually rise from about 50 °F (10
        °C) into the low 70s F (low 20s C) daily. The hot-weather season lasts from March to mid-June. May, the
        hottest month, is characterized by daily high temperatures in the upper 90s F (about 37 °C) and low
        temperatures in the mid-70s F (mid-20s C). The season of the southwest monsoon, from mid-June to October,
        brings nearly all of the state’s annual rainfall, which ranges from about 40 inches (1,000 mm) in the
        west-central part of the state to more than 60 inches (1,500 mm) in the southwest. Rainfall on the plateau
        is generally heavier than on the plains. Nearly half of the annual precipitation falls in July and August.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 id=pna>Plant and animal life</h2>
    <p>More than one-fourth of Jharkhand’s land area is forested. Most forests occur on the Chota Nagpur plateau; those
        on the plain largely have been cleared to allow cultivation of the land. The natural vegetation is deciduous
        forest; Chota Nagpur is rich in sal (Shorea robusta), a valuable hardwood. Other trees include the asan
        (Terminalia tomentosa), the leaves of which provide food for the silkworms of the sericulture industry, as well
        as several trees that are important in the production of lac (a resinous substance used to make varnishes). The
        tree locally known as mahua (Madhuca longifolia) yields sweet edible flowers that are used to make liquor.
        Bamboo and bhabar (an Indian fibre grass; Ischaemum angustifolium) from Chota Nagpur supply raw materials for
        paper manufacture. Among the other common trees, most of which are found in the plain, are the banyan (Ficus
        benghalensis), Bo tree (or pipal; Ficus religiosa), and palmyra palm (Borassus flabellifer).</p>

    <p>The Hazaribag Wildlife Sanctuary is noted for its Bengal tigers. These endangered animals, along with leopards,
        elephants, and bears, inhabit only the more remote forests. Various species of small mammals, birds, reptiles,
        and fish are plentiful throughout the state.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 id=rds>Relief, drainage, and soils</h2>
    <p>The most prominent physical feature of Jharkhand is the Chota Nagpur plateau, part of the vast Deccan plateau
        that occupies most of peninsular India. Chota Nagpur, actually a series of plateaus, hills, and valleys, covers
        nearly the entire state and consists primarily of crystalline rocks. The main plateaus, Hazaribag and Ranchi,
        are separated by the faulted sedimentary coal-bearing basin of the Damodar River, and they average about 2,000
        feet (610 metres) in elevation. In the west there are more than 300 dissected but flat-topped plateaus (called
        pats), many with elevations of more than 3,000 feet (900 metres). The highest point in Jharkhand is formed by
        the conical granite peak of Parasnath, which rises to 4,477 feet (1,365 metres) on the Hazaribag plateau; it is
        sacred in the Jain religion and to the Santhal people. Lowland plains flank the plateaus in the northwestern and
        northeastern parts of the state.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 id=rp>Resources and power</h2>
    <p>The Chota Nagpur plateau is the richest mineral belt in India, and it is responsible for a significant share (by
        value) of the country’s mineral yield. Jharkhand produces almost the entire national output of copper, kyanite
        (used in the manufacture of heat-resistant porcelain), pyrite (used to make sulfuric acid), and phosphate, as
        well as much of the output of bauxite (a source of aluminium), mica, kaolin and other clays, and iron ore. Most
        of these minerals are mined in the districts of East and West Singhbhum. Coal, however, accounts for the bulk of
        Jharkhand’s mineral production. The principal coalfields, all in the Damodar River valley in eastern Jharkhand,
        supply most of the coking coal of India.</p>
    <p>The Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) is the most prominent multipurpose power project of Jharkhand. The
        corporation operates several thermal plants and hydroelectric dams not only in Jharkhand but also in
        neighbouring West Bengal; all the stations are networked within the DVC grid, which serves urban and rural areas
        in both states.
