            <h2>Forests</h2>
            <p>The state of jharkhand has a unique relation with forest since ancient times. The word ‘Jharkhand’
                connotes ‘area of land covered with forests’. Therefore, literally as well as symbolically, Jharkhand is
                associated with forests. Various ethnic groups such as Munda, Oraon, Ho, Santhal, Paharia, Chero,
                Birjea, Asura and other have influenced their ecosystems by varying practices of agro-pastoralism over
                the years. Traditionally, these indigenous people have symbiotic relations with forests. Local festivals
                like Sarhul and Karma are customarily related with worshipping of trees.</p>

            <p>The state with a geographical area of 79,714 km² constitutes 2.42% of the country’s area. The total
                recorded forest area of the state is 23,605 km² which is 29.61% of the geographical area of the state.
                Of the total recorded forest area, Reserved Forests constitute 18.58%, Protected Forests 81.28%, and
                Unclassed Forests 0.14%. As per India State of Forest Report, 2017 published by Forest Survey of India,
                forest cover in the state is 23, 553 km² which is 29.54% of the state’s geographical area. The total
                forest and tree cover put together, it constitutes about 33.21% of the geographical area of the state.

            <h2 style="clear: both;">Eco-tourism</h3>
                <p>Ecotourism is a new concept in tourism. It is a purposeful travel to natural areas to understand the
                    cultural and natural history of environment, taking care not to alter the integrity of the
                    ecosystem,
                    while producing economic opportunities that make conservation of natural resources beneficial to
                    local
                    people. In short, ecotourism can be conceptualised as Any tourism programme that is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Nature based</li>
                    <li>Ecologically sustainable</li>
                    <li>Where education and interpretation is a major component</li>
                    <li>Where local people are benefitted</li>
                </ol>
                <p>can be called ecotourism. If it does not satisfy any one of these components then it cannot be called
                    a real ecotourism venture. With this background, the Government of Jharkhand has resolved to make
                    the promotion of ecotourism in the State a priority area. The focus shall be on conservation of
                    natural resources through awareness building, diversification of tourism activities and
                    destinations, and local community participation. This is aimed at informing and sensitizing the
                    general public and related Government Departments towards ecotourism and laying down the framework
                    for its growth in the State in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner.</p>
