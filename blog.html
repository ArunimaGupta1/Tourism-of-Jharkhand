        <p>Nowadays it is impossible to understand the world of travel & tourism without the opinion of bloggers;
            what they say on Facebook, twitter and other social networks matters. Thanks to the access to our social
            media accounts through the smartphones it has taken an even greater role.</p>

        <p >Blogging is a trend that will do nothing but grow at the expense of the magazines; especially specialist
            media will be in the background.</p>

        <p >Today’s traveller looks for experiences through travel blogs, which have become a source of inspiration for
            destination search and vacation planning.</p>
        <p >Bloggers are the journalists of the New Century. Their audiences in many cases exceed from any traditional
            written media.</p>

        <p>The Blogger is a key influencer in the industry, a communicator who knows the sector first-hand, understands
            how things work in advocacy, keeps sources and contacts, has proven experience and does a good job offering
            relevant content and quality stories. Those bloggers who receive a high volume of visits, have social media
            followers, and get good positions in rankings are the “kings”.</p>
