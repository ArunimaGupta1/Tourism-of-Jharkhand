        <p><i>Adventure sports are gaining popularity in Jharkhand as the topography and focus on developing facilities
                draw huge number of adventure seekers</i></p>
        <p>Want a shot of adrenalin dangling from a hilltop or know take on the thrill of ascending steep steps and
            camping in the wild? Well, all these activities and more that is present in Jharkhand and captivating the
            tourists with its versatile charm. These adventure hotspots, being developed by Department of tourism, are
            attracting hordes of youngsters both from within as well as neighboring states.</p>
        <div="wtud">
            <h2>Walk till you drop</h2>
            <p><b>Activity: Rock Climbing/ Trekking</b></p>
            <p style="float: left;">Being a state blessed with hilly topography, Jharkhand has scores of locations ideal
                for rock climbing.
                “Almost every city in the state has hillocks which can be safely used for rock climbing activities,”
                says Ravi Ranjan, a professional mountaineer and the only coach for rock climbing in the city, adding,
                “there is a lot of interest among youth who want to enjoy the thrill of balancing themselves delicately
                over loose rocks and climb the summit. I have many students from Jamshedpur, Giridih and Hazaribagh.
                Rock climbing also attracts the thrill seekers from other states as well, who either go to Jamshedpur or
                Giridih for best possible experience,” he says.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, trekking through forests of Jharkhand is like a dream come true for nature lovers.
                “Though there are trekking trips to denser forests arranged at various locations in Chaibasa and
                Netarhat, which may entail trekking of no less than 10 days, Ranchi and nearby locations also offer
                easier options for amateur groups. The trekking route from Sikidiri in Ramgarh to Dasam falls on the
                outskirts of Ranchi is especially popular among the enthusiasts,” says Gaurav Chhabra, an avid trekker.

                <h2 style="clear: both;">Up in the air</h2>
                <p><b>Activity: Paragliding, Parasailing, Hot air balloon</b></p>
                <p>“The geographic location of Ranchi, which has a hilly topography along with some
                    large grounds leaves a lot of scope for aerial adventure sports like parasailing, paragliding,
                    aeromodelling, hilltop paragliding and hot air balloon. In fact, the adventure camp we had organised
                    in Morabadi, earlier this year saw a huge turnout. The interest is gradually increasing among the
                    people and depending upon the the interest, we keep organising such camps across the state. Apart
                    from Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Deoghar and Giridih have also been billed as an ideal spot for aero
                    sports,” says Gurpreet Singh, Director NAF Jharkhand foundation and an aero sport enthusiast
                    himself.</p>

                <h2>Flow with the Tide</h2>
                <p><b>Activity: Canoeing, Kayaking, Waterskiing & Water rafting</b></p>
                <p>“I have been involved in water sports for close to 15 years now. I started off with trips to
                    Uttarakhand and Himachal as I was studying in Delhi back then. Now I prefer to do all this in
                    Jharkhand itself as it has some really scenic locations across the state. Kanke Dam is probably the
                    best known open water body, which has become the hotbed of water sport activities of late. Because
                    of its location within a populated area and consequent ease of access, the amateur adventure seekers
                    prefer Kanke Dam for a quick dose of kayaking, canoeing, water skiing etc. Though we have larger
                    water bodies in the close vicinity of the city — such as Patratu Dam and Rukka Dam — these places
                    are still developing and will take some time. However, if you move out of Ranchi, there are other
                    options such as Dimna lake in Jamshedpur and Bakarar river in Giridih. Dimna lake is especially
                    popular among the adventure seekers, especially the first timers because of its huge size and
                    availability of almost all type of equipment. There are coaches too, who organise various training
                    camps for people who are interested in learning river rafting, water skiing and canoeing,” says
                    Vinod Katyal, a businessman and water sport enthusiast.</p>

                <p>Palamau Tiger Reserve spread across 1026 sq kms, Palamau tiger reserve is the first sanctuary where
                    the tiger consensus was first marked by the pug marks. Betla National Park – Apart from tiger, Betla
                    National Park is the home of Indian dogs, chinkaras, elephants, langurs, leopards, sloth bears and
                    porcupines and lot more. Other attractions include Palamau fort and upper and lower ghagri
                    waterfalls.</p>
